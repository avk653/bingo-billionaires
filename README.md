# Code Changes
Before changing code, please fork into your own branch.

Check with others in the group before merging to the master branch.

# HTML Code
I have moved all the html code and other things into pages to keep it all together
none of the pages are adaptive as of yet and they only have a few basic comments
the base code file is just a page without any content

accountsLO is the page for accounts with them logged out

accountsLI is the page for the accounts with them logged in

changeDetails is a page where the users can edit their details

# Bank acount checking
Since we arn't using real bank details we need to simulate checking if it is valid and if they are underage.

I make a check using JS.

If the account number ends in '02' then they are underage

If the account number starts with '11' then the account is not valid
